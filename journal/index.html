            <h2>Post 3 - Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
            <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a>

                Visual thinking is a powerful tool that enhances comprehension and creativity by leveraging imagery and spatial understanding. The article "10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills" (see link above) emphasizes the importance of using compelling visuals to foster analytical skills. In my experience as a designer, I've found that well-crafted visuals not only capture attention but also convey complex ideas more effectively than text alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                A website form I discovered that exemplifies the fusion of imagery and interactivity to inspire visual thinking is Osmo (see link above). Osmo's design employs vibrant visuals and interactive elements that engage users in a playful yet educational experience. One of its key strengths is its use of vibrant, high-quality imagery and engaging animations that immediately capture the user's attention. The website effectively combines storytelling with interactivity, allowing users to explore Osmo's educational products through smooth transitions and dynamic visuals. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, while Osmo’s design is visually compelling, it does present some drawbacks. The heavy use of animations and transitions, while engaging, may lead to longer loading times, which can be frustrating for users with slower internet connections. Additionally, the emphasis on aesthetics may sometimes overshadow usability—certain interactive elements, while visually appealing, could be less intuitive for users unfamiliar with highly dynamic web designs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite these concerns, Osmo's website remains a strong example of how interactive visuals can be used to inspire learning and engagement, making it a relevant case study for understanding the role of visual thinking in web design.

            <h2>Post 2 - Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
            <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</a>
            <p>
                The article “Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows” (see link above) provides a comprehensive guide on the effective use of modal windows in user interface design. The author emphasizes that, while modals can simplify interfaces and save screen space, their overuse or improper implementation can lead to user frustration, likening them to the intrusive pop-up windows of the past.
            </p>
            <p>
               This article made me rethink how I approach these elements in UI design. I’ve often used modals as a quick solution for capturing user input or displaying additional content, but this article highlighted the importance of intentionality. The reminder that modals should not be overused, especially for error messages or notifications, really resonated with me. I’ve seen firsthand how intrusive modals can disrupt the user experience, especially when they appear unexpectedly or lack clear exit options.
            </p>
            <p>
                One key takeaway for me was the emphasis on user-initiated modals. I hadn’t always considered how disruptive forced modals can be, particularly when they demand immediate attention without warning. Moving forward, I plan to be more mindful about when and how I implement modals, ensuring they genuinely enhance the experience rather than interrupt it. Additionally, the discussion about accessibility and usability on mobile devices reinforced the importance of adapting designs based on context rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach.

            <p>
                The article “Best Practices for Form Design” (see link above) offers a clear and practical guide to creating user-friendly forms, making it especially useful for newer designers. It covers key design principles like grouping related fields, using single-column layouts for better usability, and ensuring clear labeling—all foundational elements of effective form design. While much of the advice might feel familiar to seasoned designers, it serves as a great reminder of the basics we sometimes overlook when designing products. I particularly appreciated the emphasis on accessibility, such as supporting keyboard navigation and providing helpful error messages, which are critical for creating inclusive designs. While the article doesn’t delve deeply into more complex challenges, it’s a strong resource for reinforcing best practices. Overall, it’s a helpful read that highlights the importance of thoughtful, user-focused design.

            <p>
                A website form that I think exemplifies best practices is the LinkedIn sign-up form (see link above). The form employs clear and concise labels and provides real-time feedback through validating user data. The user flow is logical and seamless, and ensures that users can sign up as efficiently as possible.
