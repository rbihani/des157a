        I will have cropped versions of my doodles rotating in a carousel. The cropped doodles will allow users to have a peek at the details of the doodle without revealing the entire doodle at once. All images of my doodles will be scanned. In my experiment, I had a blur effect on the initial cropped image, but I will not have any effect on the final version of the project.

            When the user clicks on a doodle, it will zoom out and show the doodle in its entirety in an overlay. There will be some text on the side that explains the significance of the doodle, and why it is personal and important to me. I will also have a "back to carousel" way to exit out of the overlay to return back to the carousel.
