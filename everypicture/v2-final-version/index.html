                <p>
                    There isn't any particular introspective story with this doodle. I had gone on a walk and seen a bunch of really beautiful flowers, and I had felt inspired. Luckily, I had my book with me, so I began to draw the flowers. The face of the woman kind of happened on its own - I wasn't planning on drawing her but after I was done, it felt like the flowers were grown for her :)

                    I drew this after I had reheard the story of Medusa and saw the character in a different light. I wanted to capture Medusa, not as a monster, but as a powerful figure.  The snakes aren’t a curse - they’re her intuition, her protectors, moving with her, never against her. The flowers represent the softness she never let the world take from her, the beauty she kept even when the world only saw her as dangerous.

                    I doodled this during a point in my life when I felt like I was being pulled in a dozen different directions. I couldn’t tell if I was growing or just breaking. It felt like my heart was working overtime, holding it all together. But slowly, without me even noticing, something started to shift. Out of all that chaos, new things began to take root - opportunities I hadn’t expected, connections I didn’t know I needed, a version of myself I hadn’t met yet.

                    I doodled this during a period of my life where there were a lot of changes happening. I was initially fearful and nervous about the effects of these changes, but all the effects eventually ended up benefitting me. I wanted to combine the butterfly and domino effect to emphasize that everything does affect everything, but that can be a beautiful thing. I plan to get this tattooed sometime in the future as well!

                    I drew this image after rereading a Greek mythology that I used to enjoy when I was younger. Stories such as The Champion of Elysius and The Minotuar, Medusa, and Icarus all entertained me as a child, and rereading them made me feel like a young girl again. This doodle is my perspective of The Champion of Elysius. I drew this without lifting the pen off the paper :)!

                    I drew this image around 2 weeks before I moved out to attend UC Riverside. Before this, it hadn't really hit me that I was going to be moving far away from home, but at the 2 week mark my parents decided it was time to start packing. Watching my childhood room get packed into a bunch of boxes was incredibly emotional, and I felt that I was saying goodbye to a part of myself. The hands symbolize me letting go of my younger self as I started a new chapter of my life far away from home.
