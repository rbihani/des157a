                I drew this image around 2 weeks before I moved out to attend UC Riverside. Before this, it hadn't really hit me that I was going to be moving far away from home, but at the 2 week mark my parents decided it was time to start packing. Watching my childhood room get packed into a bunch of boxes was incredibly emotional, and I felt that I was saying goodbye to a part of myself. The hands symbolize me letting go of my younger self as I started a new chapter of my life far away from home.
